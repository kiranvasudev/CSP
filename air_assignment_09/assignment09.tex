	\item \textbf{Answer the following questions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{What are Knowledge-Based agents?}
		\item \textbf{What is Knowledge Base (KB)?}
		\item \textbf{Which operations can Knowledge-Based agents perform?}
		\item \textbf{What is logical reasoning?}
		\item \textbf{What is syntax ?}
		\item \textbf{What is a model?}
		\item \textbf{What is entailment ?}
		\item \textbf{What is inference ?}
		\item \textbf{What is the difference between entailment and inference?}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Evaluate the performance of the algorithm and the different ordering strategies. For example, number of evaluations, path length for each of the given scenarios etc. An evaluation is performed any time the constraints associated with a partial path are checked
		for satisfaction.}
